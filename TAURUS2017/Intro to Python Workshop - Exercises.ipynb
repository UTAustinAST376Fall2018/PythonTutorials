    "# Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2017 TAURUS Programming Workshop will run for two days: Tuesday 6/13 and Thursday 6/15. The following are a list of exercises which you'll be able to follow along with during the workshop, and these will also be available for you to work on whenever you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Day One\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with some Unix commands - so these won't be something you carry out in this notebook. All of you will be using either a Linux machine or a Mac, so the terminal operates more or less the same way. Thank heavens none of you are using PC :)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command Line Tools \n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, open up a terminal in your home directory. To double check it's your home directory, type\n",
    "\n",
    "    pwd\n",
    "    \n",
    "and this should return /Users/yourusername.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make a directory where you can store all of your work for the summer. \n",
    "\n",
    "    mkdir ut2017\n",
    "    \n",
    "If you're reading this, then you already downloaded my zip file of materials here. Go ahead and move all those files into this new directory, using mv:\n",
    "\n",
    "    mv downloaded_files ut2017\n",
    "    \n",
    "To change into that directory, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd ut2017\n",
    "    \n",
    "(To go back to a parent directory above the one you're in, you can type cd ..; to get back to your home directory, just type cd; and to type the full path of anywhere you want to go on your computer, ~/ is the shortcut for \"/Home/Users/blahblahblah\" so you can begin your path with \"~/Documents\" for example.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's take a look at what we have in here. It should be all of the files you just moved. \n",
    "\n",
    "    ls\n",
    "   \n",
    "There are a bunch of customizable options with ls. For instance, ls -l will list all the files including the associated permissions and the size of the file. ls * will organize things by subdirectories and their contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever want to check the sizes of your files - especially helpful when working with huge datasets and all of a sudden your disk is full -  you can use disk usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "    du -sh *\n",
    "    \n",
    "du indicates disk usage, and the -sh makes it in a readable format in directory order. You can also sort it by file size doing this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    du -sh * | sort -r\n",
    "    \n",
    "One other way to quickly search for files of a certain type is by selectively using the asterisk. * in Unix/Linux indicates \"all\". You can search for all text files, for instance, by doing\n",
    "\n",
    "    ls *.txt\n",
    "    \n",
    "So ls will give you only those files ending in .txt. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how to look for files, let's talk real fast about manipulating files. You won't necessarily need to do this in this exercise, but it's helpful to learn the best text editor for you. Common ones include vi, macvim, and emacs. This will allow you to quickly edit scripts as well as your bashrc/bash_profile files.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start a new file, just type vi and then the new filename. If you type in a name that already exists, it will open that file. Since we aren't going to write any input files today, let's just edit your bashrc and create a simple alias.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an alias, the syntax is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    alias adobe='open -a Adobe\\ Acrobat\\ Reader'\n",
    "    \n",
    "and you'll want that to go in your bashrc file, which you can access by typing vi ~/.bashrc and writing this command. To begin typing in vi, press the \"i\" key (for insert). When you're done typing, press ESC to exit insert mode. And then type :wq+ENTER to save (w) and quit (q) the file.\n",
    "    \n",
    "If you ever want to open a program from the terminal the long way, you just write open -a program_name. If the program has spaces in it, you'll want to indicate that with a backslash after each word that has a space after it. An alias takes away the tedium of writing out long commands, and it just means that when you write the alias command, it will carry out the longer one you've created a shortcut for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, that's all for vi for now. Let's briefly talk about copying and removing files.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a good idea in research to make copies of files that you're going to manipulate for your analysis. To copy a file, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cp filename.txt filenamecopy.txt\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can also copy a file from another directory to a different directory. Let's create a dummy file just to get you used to moving it around.\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd\n",
    "    vi dummy.txt (:wq)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's try copying it into your research directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd ut2017\n",
    "    cp ../dummy.txt .\n",
    "    \n",
    "So that means go to the directory above me and copy dummy.txt here.\n",
    "\n",
    "To delete the file, use rm. *BE CAREFUL WITH RM!!* Removing a single file is pretty harmless, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "    rm dummy.txt\n",
    "    \n",
    "Gone! But to delete a directory and all its contents, you'll type:\n",
    "\n",
    "    rm -rf directoryname\n",
    "    \n",
    "Be cautious! Don't delete directories that have data in them! \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, you can go back home and delete dummy.txt. By the way, if you ever want to copy a directory and all its contents to another directory, you'll use cp -r.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's about all you need to know for basic command line navigation. \n",
    "\n",
    "    ls: list what's here\n",
    "    \n",
    "    cp: copy\n",
    "    \n",
    "    mv: move (also rename)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    rm: remove\n",
    "    \n",
    "    pwd: where am i\n",
    "    \n",
    "    du -sh: show files with their sizes in bytes\n",
    "    \n",
    "    vi: handy dandy txt editor\n",
