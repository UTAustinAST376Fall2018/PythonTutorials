If you are comfortable with your python programing skills but would like to learn more about the science, and specifically astronomy, related packages check out day 3 and 4 of the TAURUS2018 tutorials [here](https://github.com/UTAustinAST376Fall2018/PythonTutorials/blob/master/TAURUS2018/Day3.ipynb) and [here](https://github.com/UTAustinAST376Fall2018/PythonTutorials/blob/master/TAURUS2018/Day4.ipynb).

(The TAURUS2017 and TAURUS2018 tutorials are fairly similar)
